Other things worth thinking about:

Logging 
(when, where, what library (sfl4j, log4j2, etc.), remote logging (papertrail, etc.))

Error handling best practices 
(catching exceptions, logging errors, http response in the event of an error)

Database security
(users, groups, access, encryption, etc.)

Secret storage and security
(Hashicorp Vault, Java Keystores, etc.)

Microservice message queues

Additional API input validation 
(trim()ing string inputs, checking emails and phone numbers against RFC standards, etc.)

How to securely generate password reset links, sms codes, account secrets, password salt, etc.
